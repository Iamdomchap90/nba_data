# NBA Stat Scraper

A simple application that runs in your local terminal to acquire some basic performance stats over various seasons of the 24/25 nba calendar.
These stats would be used to potentially highlight any undervalued teams that may be worth betting on.

# Getting Started 

Dependencies are managed with poetry so after cd-ing into the repository run:

    poetry shell
    poetry install

the environment should be ready to simply run the scraper so:

    python3 nba_scraper.py

run tests with following command:

    pytest .
